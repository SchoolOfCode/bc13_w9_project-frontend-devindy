Team DevIndy consisting of Chet Jogia, Alex Chappell, Jason Riley, Luke Adams have developed an application to aid School of Code bootcampers to peer learn. 
The motivation behind this project is to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the cohort so you can easily go to the bootcampers profile and see when they 
are free to either help you, if you are struggling, or whether you can help them. 

This is the front-end Repo for the application, using the React Framework.
